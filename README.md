I've decided that the *Backpack* works well for the reason that I have used the same
trusty backpack for a number of years. It has a load of character, and I never
leave home without it, whether I am going to work, traveling, or just going to
the beach. It stores everything I need for the day, from my camera, laptop, journal,
pens and paper, to vitals like a bottle of water and suncream.

My backpack is like my design style: lightweight, essential, extremely versatile,
usable, useful and minimalistic. It has buckets of character, and lived, real-world
life experience.

Most importantly, it has been with me on my journey to now, every step of the way.
